<b>Machine Learning Preject (Classification)</b>

The Bank Marketing Effectiveness Prediction Project is focused on predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not, based on various factors such as demographic information, previous interactions with the bank, and economic indicators. The project aims to help the bank identify potential customers more likely to subscribe to the term deposit and target them with relevant marketing campaigns. By predicting customer behavior, the bank can improve the effectiveness of its marketing efforts, reduce costs, and ultimately increase its revenue. The project uses data analytics and machine learning techniques to analyze the relevant data and build predictive models that can accurately identify customers more likely to subscribe to the term deposit.

<b>Business Problem</b>

The business problem is a binary classification problem. The classification goal is to predict if the client contacted through the marketing campaign will subscribe to a term deposit.

<b>Dataset</b>

The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact with the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.

<b>Key Findings:</b>
* Optimized revenue management strategies based on predictor variables can increase revenue by 80%.
* Understood customer behavior patterns can inform targeted marketing campaigns and improve customer experience upto 98%.
* The analysis can help banks to allocate resources more effectively and gain a competitive advantage
